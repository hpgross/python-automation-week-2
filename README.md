# python-automation-week-2

This project is to practice using the requests library in python to post responses to a Django server via REST-based APIs.

It contains one file, run.py, that will take as input the IP address of the server that it is to be posting to. It will then take the contents of /data/feedback, serialize them, and post them as requests.

To run, ensure that run.py is executable, then run ./run.py <server IP address>
